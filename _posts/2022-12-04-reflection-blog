######Understanding and Defining Digital Humanities

My understanding of digital humanities (DH) has grown as the semester progressed 
because previously, I had *no* experience with it. In fact, if someone were to ask me before I 
took this class what digital humanities is, I would not have a definite answer. My definition of DH 
after taking a course in it is now "a field that blends technology with one or more humanities 
fields to provide useful and interactive information that will improve the world." After completing 
this class, I have a better understanding of DH, especially how broad it is. I have done peer 
reviews for projects that have covered a range of subjects from immigration to sports statistics.
