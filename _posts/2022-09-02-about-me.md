Career and Other Goals




Volunteer Experience/First Career Interest
I volunteered at my local library (https://henricolibrary.org/twin-hickory) from sophomore year of high school to my senior year of high school. I thought I wanted to be a librarian when I first arrived at CNU, so I worked in the library's media center from my freshman year to my sophomore year of college.
