### Introduction/Why This Class  
I'm Rachel J. Smith (she/her), and I'm a senior at CNU. I'm a psychology major with minors in linguistics and writing. I'm in ENGL 350, or Writing for the Digital Humanities, for my writing minor, to improve my skills as a writer, and to try something new.  

### Career and Other Goals
#### Career goals
* After graduation, I plan to work in a college registrar's office in Richmond, VA.  

#### Life goals
* My dreams are to live in Glen Allen, VA (close to Richmond), get married, and have a family.    
* Another goal I have is writing a half autobiography and half guidebook for autistic children and their parents because I'm autistic and want to help others with similar experiences.

### Volunteer Experience/First Career Interest
I volunteered at [my local library](https://henricolibrary.org/twin-hickory) from sophomore year of high school to my senior year of high school. I wanted to be a librarian when I first arrived at CNU, so I worked in the Trible Library's media center from my freshman year to my sophomore year of college.   

### How I Discovered My (Current) Career Interest  
As a freshman still getting my bearings, I developed an interest in looking at the schedule of classes, creating my schedules, and scouring the course catalog. After realizing I didn't want to be a librarian, my next career choice was being a registrar. I found out how to apply to CNU's registrar's office, interviewed, and became a student worker in the registrar's office in the fall semester of my junior year. Within a month or so of working there, I fell in love with the field. My colleagues are kind and great role models, plus, the work allows me to be detail-oriented while helping people with something I enjoy.  

### College Activities  
I joined CNU's [Campus Activities Board](https://www.instagram.com/cnucab/) in February of this year as a member of the Leisure Studies committee. We help plan relaxing events for CNU students. We recently had our first event of the year and the semester, a casino night, this Friday, and it was successful and rewarding. I'm also a part of CNU's Pokemon Go club, which involves doing in-game events with other people and planning meetups. I will be a member of Delight CNU, an all-female Christian ministry, as well.  

### Hobbies
Outside of college and work, I love...  
* Spending time with my friends, boyfriend, and family because they bring me so much joy, teach me new things, and I love them
* Baking at home- I enjoy creating sweet treats for people
* Teaching myself how to cook at school because I have a five meal plan, and cooking is a life skill
* Playing Pokemon Go by myself or with others- it started as something my boyfriend and I did together, but for me, it became so much more
* Crafting, specifically making custom birthday cards for friends and family because I love showing and telling people how much I appreciate them (below is a card I made this summer for my friend's birthday)
* Doing Wordle and its five siblings: Dordle, Tridle, Quordle, Octordle, and Sedecordle, the most challenging, every morning or whenever I can- I _love_ words and word puzzles
* Reading because nothing beats getting lost in a good book
* Watching anime- my boyfriend, Seth, wanted me to watch _Sword Art Online_ with him in December. Long story short, I now love anime and watch shows with him every weekend.
* Celebrating holidays in every way possible because it makes me happy. It also gives me an excuse to go to craft stores and stock up on decorations.

### Hometown and Family  
I'm from Glen Allen, VA and have lived there for all of my life. My amazing, incredibly supportive parents and grandparents influence me so much, and I would not be the person I am today without them. I have two younger siblings, a sister who is a junior at Virginia Tech and a brother who is a freshman at UVA. My boyfriend, Seth, and I met our freshman year of high school, started dating that April, and have been together ever since.   

### The Most Important Part of My Blog: My Dogs  
My adorable, hilarious dogs are Lola and Kody. Lola, our sweet, bossy 12-year-old shepherd-husky mix, loves sleeping, welcoming guests with her wagging tail, and wandering into the kitchen. Kody, our feisty and protective 9-year-old black Pomeranian, enjoys using his voice to assert his presence, playing with his toys, and being held- when he feels like it.
