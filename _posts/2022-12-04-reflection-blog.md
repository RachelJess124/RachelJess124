# Understanding and Defining Digital Humanities  

My understanding of digital humanities (DH) has grown as the semester progressed  
because previously, I had _no_ experience with it. In fact, if someone were to ask me before I  
took this class what digital humanities is, I would not have a definite answer. My definition of DH  
after taking a course in it is now "a field that blends technology with one or more humanities  
fields to provide useful and interactive information that will improve the world." After completing  
this class, I have a better understanding of DH, especially how broad it is. I have done peer  
reviews for projects that have covered a range of subjects from immigration to sports statistics.  

# Assignments I Struggled With and Found Useful 

I _really_ struggled with writing my grant since it was unlike any other assignment I have  
done for both writing intensive and non writing intensive classes. I also felt unqualified to write  
this grant due to a lack of experience in my topic, 1920s fashion. However, it did help me  
understand and appreciate how much work goes into writing a grant. 

![My week 12, tweet #3 showing how much I struggled with the grant project. It reads: 'Is anyone else 
struggling to get enough words for their grant proposal and/or dealing with impostor syndrome about writing it?
I feel like I don't know enough about my topic or grants in general to write a proposal- it's one thing
to be taught about it and another to write it.'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RachelJess124/RachelJess124/main/images/week12tweet3.jpg)  

I found the peer reviews incredibly useful. As I learned from my creative nonfiction class  
and from this class too, having a second set of eyes helps me notice things I never would have   
considered otherwise. I also enjoy reading other people's work and editing, so the peer reviews  
gave me reasons to edit. Since DH requires peer review, this component of the class made me  
realize that collaboration is an important part of the field. The review blogs were useful as well. I  
learned how to provide an unbiased review through these assignments and to end on a light note.  

# What Would Help Future Students

I think it would help future students if they chose a topic for their grant earlier because  
they could start thinking about sources for their grant as early as when the first review blog is  
assigned. Additionally, allowing them to research DH projects related to their topic will be helpful  
for them as they go further into the class.  

# My Favorite Reading and Why

Anne Lamott's Shitty First Drafts was a refreshing read because I am a perfectionist.  
This reading brought levity to the class and allowed me to feel more comfortable with the  
messiness of writing. If published authors struggle with first drafts, that gives permission to the  
rest of us to fail and accept our imperfections and therefore our humanity.  

# What I Got Out of This Class

Using GitHub was a bit of a learning curve at first since it was new and 
technology-related. Before this class, I had almost no coding experience. As the class 
progressed, I became more comfortable with GitHub and technology in general. 
I learned how to be more concise, which surprised me since I think I am very good at 
being concise. More often than not, however, I would find myself going over the character limit 
on my weekly tweets at the start of the class.

![My week 8, tweet #2 showing me going over Twitter's character limit. It reads: 'After looking up 1920s DH projects to find the project I
would review for Review Blog 2, I stumbled upon UNC 
Chapel Hill's DH archive. I found The Costar Project,
which Chapel Hill's drama department contributed to
and focuses on clothes from the 19th and 20th centuries, making (1/2)
it perfect for my DH project grant. I look forward to exploring it further and
possibly using it in my annotated bibliography. #CNUEngl350'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RachelJess124/RachelJess124/main/images/week8tweet2.jpg)  

Overall, I believe I have grown as a writer because this class is unlike any other writing  
class I have taken at CNU. I have mostly taken creative writing classes in my writing minor, so I  
needed this class to become a more well-rounded writer. Writing across all genres is a useful  
skill because it allows me to reach more people and work well in many situations.
