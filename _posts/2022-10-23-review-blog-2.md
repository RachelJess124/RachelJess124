# Summary
The Costar Project, based in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Department of  Dramatic Art, has a digital and in-person archive of garments from around the world and from  eras to the Early Victorian (1836-1850) to the New Look Era (1947-1957).

The in-person collection of clothes is in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's  Department of Dramatic Art, which, along with PlayMakers Repertory Company, helped develop  the project. The reasoning for photographing and conserving the clothes is to limit clothes  handling to scholars and interested students. The garments themselves range from accessories  like hats, jewelry, and shoes to everyday clothes like shirts and dresses.  
Students in Chapel  Hill's Master of Fine Arts program in costume production select a  "...fully boned bodice or dress from the archive and research it…", write supplemental pages  that go on the site, create the garment's pattern, and reproduce it to fit someone in the present  (Adamson, 2002). As of May 2021, students in this program have researched and recreated  approximately 50 of these  bodices and dresses.  

# How The Costar Project Relates to the Digital Humanities
The project uses the website to advance its goal of displaying its archive of 19th and  20th century clothes because visitors can filter the garments by era, such as the Edwardian era  from 1901 to 1909, and see more clothes on the screen they are using to visit the website than  they could in person. The Costar Project is an excellent resource for people who want  information on clothes from a specific era or who want to compare and contrast different eras  from 1836 to 1957.  
Since digital humanities and The Costar Project is open access, that means everyone,  whether they are a scholar or not, can visit this site and view the collection of garments as well  as the masters students' research. The website itself is easy to navigate, even for someone who  is new to the project or digital humanities. The images that each garment has are clear and  allow visitors to see potential damages and the detail that went into each garment's creation.  
The Costar Project acknowledges UNC's IT groups, Tomcat and Oracle, along with  IntelJ's educational licenses, for contributing to their project's technology. This software is open  source, which means "...the software itself can be modified because it's accessible to the public"  (Opensource.com). Each page of the archive displays 21 garments, something that would be  difficult and resource consuming to do in person due to the effort it would take to display the  items and put them back afterwards.

The Costar Project relates to history because the garments themselves come from all  over the world and are associated with different time periods in the 19th and 20th centuries. The  only mention of history is in the project's homepage, which acknowledges the difficulty of giving  clothes a specific date for when they existed and instead provides a range of dates that the item  was or could have been worn in. The Costar Project does not explain the clothes' historical  context except for a few items, like a suffragette bandana, or why people at the time gravitated  towards these styles.  

# Issues
There are a few issues with this project. For example, there are two typos on the  homepage alone, which may make visitors question at first glance if they should trust the site.  

![The homepage's typos, exensive in the first sentence of the first paragraph and inquires in the third sentence of the second paragraph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RachelJess124/RachelJess124/main/images/grammaralertrb2.jpg)  

On the homepage in the structure section of the website, the third bullet point says that  the archive displays 15 images per page, but each page has 21 images. This should be updated  to reflect the actual image number because this may also cause visitors to question the site's  credibility.  
It would also help visitors if the site provided a few example images of what a garment's  page looks like in its user guide, along with descriptions of the pages' sections, which include  overview, trim, damage, and provenance.  
The homepage's menu bar at the top has links to the Costar Project, leading back to the  homepage; the project's archive, leading to the clothes archive; and the Nowes Ark holdings,  leading the visitor to a different project focusing on clothes outside of the West. This is an issue  because all of these links are redundant and should be removed.  
The second, third, and fourth paragraphs in the homepage's first section have these  links readily available if visitors want to access them. Additionally, the user guide that the site  has should be accessible from the homepage so visitors can understand how the site works  beforehand.  
In the holdings page, the most glaring issue is that when one first encounters this page,  it says on the bottom 'Showing 688 garments…' but when the search options get changed, this number  increases to 867 garments. Visitors may be confused and wonder why the first time  they visit, some clothes are not visible.  
Some eras have less available garments than others, meaning that The Costar Project  either needs more examples of garments from those eras or needs to narrow the range of eras  that it focuses on. For example, the two oldest eras that the project has are the Early Victorian  era and the Crinoline era with 29 and 58 garments respectively.  
Accessibility-wise, the search bar on the archive has small text, affecting those with  vision impairments. This text size could be increased to improve this. Also, the scroll bar above  the garments' pictures is small and could be made bigger because it is easy to miss when first  using the archive.  
It may also help visitors who are not knowledgeable about fashion if the site provided a  glossary of fashion terms used in the garment's pages like rickrack and passamenterie. Some of  the terminology was confusing, and clarification on these terms without having to do additional  research would greatly help visitors.  
These issues could cause frustration when navigating the archive, but otherwise, the site  is an excellent resource for scholars and everyday people who are interested in fashion.  

# Why This Project
This project fits what I want my DH project to look like because I want to create a  timeline of women's fashion in the 1920s. This archive has many garments from that era for me  to investigate. I appreciate the level of detail the website has about each garment and wish to  include that level of detail in my project.  
My project will discuss the historical context of clothes women wore at the time and why  they wore them in addition to providing details about individual garments, such as what its material  and any damages. While providing historical context may not be The Costar Project's main  objective, that is the main goal of my timeline of women's fashion in the 1920s.  
Overall, The Costar Project is an expertly created archive with a wide selection of  garments from the 19th and 20th centuries. Anyone interested in fashion, whether they are an  academic or not, can benefit from the project and the information it gives about every garment.
