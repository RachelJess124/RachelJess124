# Summary
The Costar Project, based in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Department of  Dramatic Art, has a digital and in-person archive of garments from around the world and from  eras to the Early Victorian (1836-1850) to the New Look Era (1947-1957).

The in-person collection of clothes is in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's  Department of Dramatic Art, which, along with PlayMakers Repertory Company, helped develop  the project. The reasoning for photographing and conserving the clothes is to limit clothes  handling to scholars and interested students. The garments themselves range from accessories  like hats, jewelry, and shoes to everyday clothes like shirts and dresses. 
Students in Chapel  Hill's Master of Fine Arts program in costume production select a  "...fully boned bodice or dress from the archive and research itâ€¦", write supplemental pages  that go on the site, create the garment's pattern, and reproduce it to fit someone in the present  (Adamson, 2002). As of May 2021, students in this program have researched and recreated  approximately 50 of these  bodices and dresses.

# How The Costar Project Relates to the Digital Humanities
The project uses the website to advance its goal of displaying its archive of 19th and  20th century clothes because visitors can filter the garments by era, such as the Edwardian era  from 1901 to 1909, and see more clothes on the screen they are using to visit the website than  they could in person. The Costar Project is an excellent resource for people who want  information on clothes from a specific era or who want to compare and contrast different eras  from 1836 to 1957.
Since digital humanities and The Costar Project is open access, that means everyone,  whether they are a scholar or not, can visit this site and view the collection of garments as well  as the masters students' research. The website itself is easy to navigate, even for someone who  is new to the project or digital humanities. The images that each garment has are clear and  allow visitors to see potential damages and the detail that went into each garment's creation.
The Costar Project acknowledges UNC's IT groups, Tomcat and Oracle, along with  IntelJ's educational licenses, for contributing to their project's technology. This software is open  source, which means "...the software itself can be modified because it's accessible to the public"  (Opensource.com). Each page of the archive displays 21 garments, something that would be  difficult and resource consuming to do in person due to the effort it would take to display the  items and put them back afterwards.

The Costar Project relates to history because the garments themselves come from all  over the world and are associated with different time periods in the 19th and 20th centuries. The  only mention of history is in the project's homepage, which acknowledges the difficulty of giving  clothes a specific date for when they existed and instead provides a range of dates that the item  was or could have been worn in. The Costar Project does not explain the clothes' historical  context except for a few items, like a suffragette bandana, or why people at the time gravitated  towards these styles.

# Issues
There are a few issues with this project. For example, there are two typos on the  homepage alone, which may make visitors question if they should trust the site.
