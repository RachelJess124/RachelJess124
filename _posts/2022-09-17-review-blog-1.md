Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark, Douglas Seefeldt, http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/

# Summary

Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark is about Thomas Jefferson's role in planning the Lewis and Clark expeditions.  This digital archive started as a collaboration between the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Virginia's Virginia Center for Digital History & Geospatial Data Center. 
 
Although Jefferson did not leave Virginia, his contributions included his only published book, Notes on the State of Virginia (Notes), along with over 200 other documents.  It contains images of some of the primary sources. This way, viewers can look at the  facsimiles while reading the transcriptions.  This inclusion of primary sources and transcriptions is  incredibly useful to every visitor, especially people who cannot read cursive.

Unfortunately, not all facsimiles work, which should be fixed. Correcting this issue could  improve user experience by providing credibility and the 'humanities' aspect of digital  humanities. The website promises users facsimiles and needs to uphold their end of the bargain  so people feel they can trust it. Not only that, the facsimiles allow users to see the authentic  documents for themselves, making history come alive for them.
