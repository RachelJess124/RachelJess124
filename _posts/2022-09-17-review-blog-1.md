Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark, Douglas Seefeldt, http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/

# Summary

Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark is about Thomas Jefferson's role in planning the Lewis and Clark expeditions.  This digital archive started as a collaboration between the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Virginia's Virginia Center for Digital History & Geospatial Data Center. 
 
Although Jefferson did not leave Virginia, his contributions included his only published book, Notes on the State of Virginia (Notes), along with over 200 other documents.  It contains images of some of the primary sources. This way, viewers can look at the  facsimiles while reading the transcriptions.  This inclusion of primary sources and transcriptions is  incredibly useful to every visitor, especially people who cannot read cursive.

Unfortunately, not all facsimiles work, which should be fixed. Correcting this issue could  improve user experience by providing credibility and the humanities aspect of digital  humanities. The website promises users facsimiles and needs to uphold their end of the bargain  so people feel they can trust it. Not only that, the facsimiles allow users to see the authentic  documents for themselves, making history come alive for them.

# How This Project Relates to Digital Humanities

The project uses maps with blue dots indicating important landmarks, like the Ohio River, along  with a selection of associated documents on the left-hand side. This feature is supplemented  with 22 map images and a geo-rectified cartographic database of eight interactive maps from  Jefferson's time. These sources relate to the site's three key topics: geopolitics, which looks at  how geography influences politics; exploration, or exploring the land beyond Virginia; and  expansion, or how America's influence affected the people already living there.

This digital archive uses primary sources like treaties, letters, and journals to discuss a historical  topic. It provides a collection of sources that no one could access in print with this website. The  project developers use data through their archive of primary sources and interactive map  database. Though the website's text is readable, massive paragraphs may overwhelm visitors.  Most of the sources are two to three pages, a reasonable read for everyone. Some sources have  upwards of 30 pages, which may alienate non-academics. A possible solution is dividing long sources so that people do not have to read the entire source.

The link about Notes on the Overview page leads to its digital counterpart, courtesy of the University of Virginia's Electronic Text Center. However, this digital book has 31 working links, which may overwhelm average viewers but will provide scholars and historians with a wealth of information. The website's overall word choice works well for its audience and explains each topic's importance in the project.

The data visualizations are easy to understand, but there are no instructions for more complicated  aspects, like the interactive maps. In our increasingly digital world, people need instructions and  refuse to spend time exploring a website to find what they are looking for. Visitors also rarely  want to explore a website unless they have a lot of interest in the topic. A nice feature of this  project is the archive view, where visitors can sort the various documents by person, native  group, place, or document type. This project is also easily accessible with a mobile phone,  allowing a new subset of people to access the site and use it as effectively as if one was browsing  on a computer.

# Issues

The site's navigation is easy to use because there is a useful menu bar on the left-hand side.  Generally, each subsection has the categories on that menu bar across the top of the page so  people have multiple options to navigate the site.

A common thread across this project is that they could be more concise in some parts of  the website. For example, a paragraph on the Overview section is 15 lines long. Paragraphs like that  could easily be broken into two separate paragraphs or shortened. However, the context  summaries provide a wealth of information about why the topics are there and Jefferson's life.  Another issue is that a good number of the links or images are broken or do not work. For  instance, the visualization view homepage is an entirely blank screen. It would be helpful for  future users if the developers provided images of what is featured or if they gave instructions on  how to use the interactive components because spending time on a website to find what one is  looking for drives visitors away and decreases credibility. As for the issue of the links and  images that do not work, they could either replace the broken images with a working format or  remove them entirely.
